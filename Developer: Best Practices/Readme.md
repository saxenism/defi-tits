## Foreword

Smart contract programming requires a different engineering mindset than what you may be used to.

The cost of failure is high and changes can be difficult, making it in some ways similar to hardware programming or financial services programming rather than web or mobile app development.

It is therefore not enough to defend against known vulnerabilities. Instead you will need to learn a new philosophy of development.

## Prepare for Failure

> Place circuit breakers
> Manage money at risk (rate limiting, maximum usage,etc)
> Effective mechanism for proxy upgrades
